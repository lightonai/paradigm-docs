# 📟 Developer documentation

We currently offer two ways to query Paradigm:

-   Directly through **[HTTP requests](/api/specifications/requests)**, the most flexible format to implement in your application.
-   Through a [Python client](https://github.com/lightonai/paradigm-client).

We offer a number of **endpoints** through which you can interact with Paradigm. Broadly, these are split in four categories:

-   ✍️ **generate and manipulate text**: **[Create](/api/endpoints/create)** enables you to **generate and manipulate text according to a prompt**.
    The possibilities with ✍️ **[Create](/api/endpoints/create)** are endless: from simply assisting with copywriting, to taking in complex instructions and performing arbitrary tasks (chatbots, keywords extraction, etc.)
    This is the main gateway to Paradigm, and **we recommend you get started with this endpoint**.

-   🔬 **understand natural language**: ️Endpoints that help you incorporate **natural language understanding** in your product. Leverage 🧪 **[Analyse](/api/endpoints/analyse)** to help your machine learning pipeline unlock unique insights,
or directly use 🔘 **[Select](/api/endpoints/select)** for text classification.

-   ✂️ **show the tokens**: see how the models **slices the text into [tokens](/introduction/tokens)** with the [Tokenize](/api/endpoints/tokenize) endpoint.
