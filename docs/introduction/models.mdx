# 游뱄 Models

The model is the magic behind Paradigm. It is a large neural network with billions of parameters, calibrated by reading and learning
from hundreds of billions of words sourced from web pages, books, scientific articles, and more. 
During this training, the model learns to model language accurately (i.e. to predict the next word of a text). 
Think about how, when sending text messages, you get suggestions trying to predict the next word you want to type. 
The variety, quality, and sheer amount of our curated training data result in universal language models, able to handle diverse tasks simply by reading and processing 
written instructions.

A single model called `llm-mini` is available through the API for pioneers.
