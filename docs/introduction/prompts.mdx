# ✍️ Prompts

The prompt is the input text you submit to Paradigm. Paradigm will generate and return text conditioned by your prompt: 
if your prompt is *"François Mitterrand was the president of"*, Paradigm will most likely return *"France"*.

The prompt will condition Paradigm to follow given instructions or style. If your prompt is formal, it is highly likely that the generated text will continue in a formal way. 
Similarly, complex styles and structures can be imposed (e.g. poems, haiku, lists). You can also give literal instructions in the prompt, such as *"Write an ad for Paradigm:"*, 
or *"This is a sentiment classifier."*. Following-up with a few structured examples can also be helpful.

You can think of the prompting process as a way to program the model to achieve your desired output. 
The more specific and the more context you can provide, the better the results. Play around to get a feel for it, and use our examples as inspiration.
